goeval
======

*goeval* is, or will become, a collection of Golang packages and applications
concerning automata and expression evaluation.

The principle purpose of this project is for me to practise writing in Go.

Among other things, the packages implement the following:


* Data structures to simulate arbitrary deterministic and nondeterministic
finite automata
* Conversion of nondeterministic to deterministic finite automata
* Construction of deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata from
regular expressions
* A library and interactive interface for the evaluation of arithmetical,
boolean and string expressions using dynamically-typed variables
